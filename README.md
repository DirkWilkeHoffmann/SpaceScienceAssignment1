# SpaceScienceAssignment1

This repository contains a submission to assignment 1 of space science algorithm. Al details regarding the assignmnet may be found in the pdf detailing the requirements. Futhermore, a report is attached summarising all findings. All code is contained within jupyter notebooks that may be compiled using a user's own virtual environment. No environment is included given that all packages are common such as numpy and sklearn. Thus, packages are likely already installed in the base environment. Note the the notebooks for part A and B have lengthy computations, the notebooks have also been exported to html for convenience.
